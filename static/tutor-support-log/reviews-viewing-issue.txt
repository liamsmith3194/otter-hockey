Please provide us with your Problem Statement. This is a clear description of the problem that you're currently facing.
At the very least, you need to tell us what should your code be doing, and what is it actually doing?
If you are getting an error, please send a screenshot.
If you are working on a particular file, which file is it, and which lines of code?
Using the same product detail template, one category of products is viewing differently to the others. I can see the issue, but unable to fix it without it breaking the categories viewing correctly.
Tutoring at Code Institute profile
What steps have you taken so far to resolve the issue, or to address current gaps in your knowledge?
Vague answers like "searched on Slack and Google" are not sufficient here. What specific steps have you taken? What code and debugging steps have you tried? What resources have you used (e.g. provide links to StackOverflow questions you have read)?
I struggled to research this issue, no one seems to have had this problem.
I have been rearranging the code for hours last night and with a fresh head this morning i'm still none the wiser.
Tutoring at Code Institute profile
One final thing. Please share your code with us. 
If you are working on Gitpod, please set your workspace to shared, and send us the link to it. If you are working on a course challenge, please send the name of the challenge.

Thank you. We will get back to you as soon as possible. You can see how busy tutoring currently is on this page: https://code-institute-org.github.io/tutoring-info/status/
Note that if you have failed to sufficiently answer any of the above questions, tutors will have to re-ask you for the information, which will use up part of your weekly tutoring time allowance.

Hi there, Alan here, how are you? You will need to better explaing you issue as its not clear from you responisives what your issue actually is?

Hi Alan, it is tricky to explain hence my issue trying to research it.
I have attached some screenshots to help
both screenshots use the same template but viewing differently, with and without reviews
Alan profile
ok i cant really see the differences from this screenshots - for this one you can either leave it and note in readme that you couldnt find the issue or build the review section bit by bitt osee where the error occurs
The first screenshot it's over the left, the second is correct with it spanning the width of the container
I'd like to try to fix it if possible
Alan profile
have you tried strip back the code as i suggest above and adding the review section step by step? You have obvs made some mistake with the structure of your html
but why would three out of four categories work, does that point to the html?
Alan profile
let me take a look, what products do i need to look at and do i need logins?
no log in needed.
the sticks display wrong all other categories view correctly, with or without a review
Alan profile
im struggle to see the dirreneces to be honest
did you get my screenshots?
Alan profile
yes but i cannnot see what the differences are
are you able to send me screenshots?
maybe its just viewing differently on mine?
Alan profile
potentially - clear cache etc, but i honestly cant see anything wrond with what you have
Just have, still different. Can you go on stick 0100

does it look like that?
straight under the image and squished?
Alan profile
see that looks fine to be
right!
That isn't how the other categories few it. It's wrong.
It should spread across the width of the screen

like that
that's the training top under clothes by the way if you want to compare
Alan profile
so what should be the full page length
correct
Alan profile
sorry , what shoulf be 1005 page witdth - in thos screenshots both look sections to be 50%
it should be row and column split in 2 50% each. Clearly the sticks aren't
I have also just noticed the hr tag is missing on the sticks
Alan profile
ok, so check that all tags are correct also check you layout is as per Bootstrap docs - see details below for layout of the bootstrap grid
Grid system · Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com)
I'm sorry Alan, but i dont see anything wrong with the grid.
Moving the include down through all the closing divs does the same thing. I have now got the position correct for sticks and broken for the other categories
Alan profile
if you look at duffle bag you will see the review is tight to the edge so there is something wrong with your layout here

but why does it work on one category and not another?
If you look at the sticks now it's right.
All I have done is move the include down one div
Alan profile
i honsetly can see what is causing the issue - it uses the same templates form what i can see as the other product so i dont get whay it displays differently
I assume you mean can't see what is causing the issue??
Alan profile
yep - im not see why its doing that
Ok well I will log it in my readme issues.
Thank you for time Alan, I know it's been frustrating
Alan profile
its annoying me that i cant spot it to be honest - best of luck with the project
10:18 am
thanks
